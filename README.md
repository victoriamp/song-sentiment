# song-sentiment
Script to determine the sentiment of songs using the Genius API, developed as an introduction to sentiment analysis and API usage.

Goal: to determine the sentiment of songs using the Genius API, and see if this is an accurate description of the sentiment of the mood of the song by comparing results to data from the Spotify API (to be implemented later).

Currently: working on the python script to determine the sentiment of a word.

Next steps:
- script to determine the sentiment of a selection of text
- script to get lyrics from a song title (and artist)
- basic interface
- check that the correct song is used (interface)
- script to determine mood of song using Spotify data
