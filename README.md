# song-sentiment

*Goal:*
- to determine the sentiment of songs using the Genius API, and see if this is an accurate description of the sentiment of the mood of the song by comparing results to data from the Spotify API (to be implemented later).

*So Far:*
- analysis.py retrieves lyrics using BeautifulSoup and requests, currently stored in out.txt (will be changed later)

*Currently:* 
- investigating options for sentiment analysis
- working on removing extraneous information from song lyrics 

*Next steps:*
- script to determine the sentiment of a selection of text
- basic interface
- check that the correct song is used (interface)
- script to determine mood of song using Spotify data
